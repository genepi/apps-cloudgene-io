This server provides a free genotype imputation service. You can upload GWAS genotypes (VCF or 23andMe format) and receive phased and imputed genomes in return. Our server offers imputation from HapMap, 1000 Genomes (Phase 1 and 3), CAAPA and the updated Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC version r1.1) panel.

In cooperation with the University of Michigan, Gon√ßalo Abecasis & Christian Fuchsberger.
