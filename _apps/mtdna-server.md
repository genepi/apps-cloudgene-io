mtDNA-Server provides a free service for the analysis of human mitochondrial DNA data, currently focusing on reliable identification of heteroplasmy (>= 1%) and contamination. mtDNA-Server can be executed without any user login. We also provide post-processing guidelines that should be applied after each automated analysis. [http://mtdna-server.uibk.ac.at/](http://mtdna-server.uibk.ac.at/)

In cooperation with the University of Innsbruck.
